# Running the OrientDB Console

Once the server is running there are various methods you can use to connect to your database server to an individual database.  Two such methods are the [Network Binary](Network-Binary-Protocol.md) and [HTTP/REST](OrientDB-REST.md) protocols.  In addition to these OrientDB provides a command-line interface for connecting to and working with the database server.


## Starting the OrientDB Console

In the OrientDB installation directory (that is, `$ORIENTDB_HOME`, where you installed the database) under `bin`, there is a file called `console.sh` for Unix-based systems or `console.bat` for Windows users.

To launch the OrientDB console, run the following command after you start the database server:

<pre>
$ <code class="lang-sh userinput">cd $ORIENTDB_HOME/bin</code>
$ <code class="lang-sh userinput">./console.sh</code>

OrientDB console v.X.X.X (build 0) www.orientdb.com
Type 'HELP' to display all the commands supported.
Installing extensions for GREMLIN language v.X.X.X

orientdb>
</pre>

The OrientDB console is now running.  From this prompt you can connect to and manage any remote or local databases available to you.

## Using the `HELP` Command

In the event that you are unfamiliar with OrientDB and the available commands, or if you need help at any time, you can use the `HELP` command, or type `?` into the console prompt.

<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">HELP</code>

AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
 * alter class &lt;command-text&gt;   Alter a class in the database schema
 * alter cluster &lt;command-text&gt; Alter class in the database schema
 ...                            ...
 * help                         Print this help
 * exit                         Close the console
</pre>

For each console command available to you, `HELP` documents its basic use and what it does.  If you know the particular command and need details on its use, you can provide arguments to `HELP` for further clarification.

<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">HELP SELECT</code>

COMMAND: SELECT
- Execute a query against the database and display the results.
SYNTAX: select &lt;query-text&gt;
WHERE:
- &lt;query-text&gt;: The query to execute
</pre>

## Connecting to Server Instances

There are some console commands, such as `LIST DATABASES` or `CREATE DATABASE`, which you can only run while connected to a server instance.  For other commands, however, you must also connect to a database, before they run without error.

>Before you can connect to a fresh server instance and fully control it, you need to know the [root password](Server-Security.md) for the database.  The root password is located in the configuration file at `config/orientdb-server-config.xml`.  You can find it by searching for the `<users>` element.  If you want to change it, edit the configuration file and restart the server.

>```xml
>...
><users>
>    <user resources="*"
>	      password="my_root_password"
>		  name="root"/>
>	<user resources="connect,server.listDatabases,server.dblist"
>	      password="my_guest_password"
>		  name="guest"/>
></users>
>...
>```

With the required credentials, you can connect to the database server instance on your system, or establish a remote connection to one running on a different machine.

<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">CONNECT remote:localhost root my_root_password</code>

Connecting to remote Server instance [remote:localhost] with user 'root'...OK
</pre>

Once you have established a connection to the database server, you can begin to execute commands on that server, such as `LIST DATABASES` and `CREATE DATABASE`.

<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">LIST DATABASES</code>

Found 1 databases:
* GratefulDeadConcerts (plocal)
 </pre>

To connect to this database or to a different one, use the `CONNECT` command from the console and specify the server URL, username, and password.  By default, each database has an `admin` user with a password of `admin`.

>**Warning**: Always [change the default password](Database-Security.md#users) on production databases.

The above `LIST DATABASES` command shows a `GratefulDeadConcerts` installed on the local server.  To connect to this database, run the following command:

<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">CONNECT remote:localhost/GratefulDeadConcerts admin admin</code>

Connecting to database [remote:localhost/GratefulDeadConcerts] with user 'admin'...OK
</pre>

The `CONNECT` command takes a specific syntax for its URL.  That is, `remote:localhost/GratefulDeadConcerts` in the example.  It has three parts:

- **Protocol**: The first part of the database address is the protocol the console should use in the connection.  In the example, this is `remote`, indicating that it should use the TCP/IP protocol.

- **Address**: The second part of the database address is hostname or IP address of the database server that you want the console to connect to.  In the example, this is `localhost`, since the connection is made to a server instance running on the local file system.

- **Database**: The third part of the address is the name of the database that you want to use.  In the case of the example, this is `GratefulDeadConcerts`.


For more detailed information about the commands, see [Console Commands](Console-Commands.md).

> **Note**: The OrientDB distribution comes with the bundled database `GratefulDeadConcerts` which represents the Graph of the [Grateful Dead's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead) concerts. This database can be used by anyone to start exploring the features and characteristics of OrientDB.
