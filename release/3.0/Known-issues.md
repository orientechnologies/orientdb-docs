## Known Issues

- The distributed module is still in active development. **Please do not use it in 3.0.0-m1.**
- The _Neo4j to OrientDB Importer_ tool has not been refactored using the new Multi-Model API. As a consequence, if you plan to use the  _Neo4j to OrientDB Importer_, please use it with the _CE-TP2_ package of OrientDB 3.0. For more information on the available 3.0 packages, please refer to this [page](Available-Packages.md).
