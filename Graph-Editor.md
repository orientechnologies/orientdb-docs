#Graph Editor

Since Studio 2.0 we have a new brand graph editor.  Not only you can visualize your data in a graph way
but you can also interact with the graph and modify it.

To populate the graph area just type a query in the query editor or use the functionality **Send To Graph** from the [Browse UI](Query.md)

* Inspect Vertices
* Change the Rendering Configuration of Vertices

## Add Vertices

To add a new Vertex in your Graph Database and in the Graph Canvas area you have to press the button
**Add Vertex**.
This operation is done in two steps.

The first step you have to choose the class for the new Vertex and then click **Next**

In the second step you have to insert the fields values of the new vertex, you can also add custom fields as OrientDB supports Schema-Less mode. To make the new vertex persistent click to **Save changes** and the 
vertex will be saved into the database and added to the canvas area
