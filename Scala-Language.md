# Scala API

There's no specific API written in Scala for OrientDB, but since there's a Java API it'easy to use that one to access OrientDB from Scala, and if needed to write wrappers around it for making a more Scala-like API.
 
Here we just explain how to start using Scala for doing some basic operations on OrientDB, based on this GitHub repository: [OrientDbScalaExample](https://github.com/andreaiacono/OrientDbScalaExample) that uses the [Graph API](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Graph-Database-Tinkerpop.html). 
To fully leverage the features of the API, refer to the Java documentation.


## Java method invocation problems

Usually the main problems are related to the difference in calling conventions between Scala and Java. Attention must be paid when passing parameters to methods with varargs like `OrientGraph.addVertex(...)`, because if not converted to java's repeated args correctly it will cause a compilation problem.

## build.sbt
Let's start defining the build.sbt. All we need is a library dependency:
```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.orientechnologies" % "orientdb-graphdb" % "2.2.0",
)
```


## Creating/Opening a Database
We can start creating/opening a database:

```
    val uri: String = "plocal:target/database/scala_sample"
    val graph: OrientGraph = new OrientGraph(uri)
```
If the database at the specified uri is existing, it will be just opened; if it's not existing, it will be created and opened.

## Creating new classes
If we need to define new classes, we can use the _createVertexType()_ method of the OrientGraph class:
```
    val person: OrientVertexType = graph.createVertexType("Person")
    person.createProperty("firstName", OType.STRING)
    person.createProperty("lastName", OType.STRING)
```
we can define as many properties we need, each one belonging to a [Type](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Types.html) (the second parameter of the _createProperty()_ method).

In the same way, we can extend edges, like in this example:
```
    val work: OrientEdgeType = graph.createEdgeType("Work")
    work.createProperty("startDate", OType.DATE)
    work.createProperty("endDate", OType.DATE)
```

## Adding vertices
If we need to add Vertices, we can use the _OrientGraph.addVertex()_ method, like in this example:
```
    val johnDoe: Vertex = graph.addVertex("class:Person", Nil: _*)
    johnDoe.setProperty("firstName", "John")
    johnDoe.setProperty("lastName", "Doe")
```
As seen before in the paragraph "Java method invocation problems", the second parameter of the _addVertex()_ method (the _Nil:_*_) is needed to tell the Scala compiler which of the overloaded version of the method to use. If not supplied, the call will not compile.

Luckily, the properties of the vertex can be specified in the constructor itself:
```
    val johnSmith: Vertex = graph.addVertex("class:Person", "firstName", "John", "lastName", "Smith")
```

## Adding edges
If we need to add edges, we can use the _OrientGraph.addEdge()_ method:
```
    val johnDoeAcme: Edge = graph.addEdge(null, johnDoe, acme, WorkEdgeLabel)
    johnDoeAcme.setProperty("startDate", "2010-01-01")
    johnDoeAcme.setProperty("endDate", "2013-04-21")
```
The first parameter of the call _addEdge()_ is the RID, which is automatically generated by OrientDB and hence not needed.
Unfortunately the edge has no overloaded constructor to pass all the properties in one call.
Another way to add an edge is starting form a vertex, like in this case:
```
    val johnSmithAcme: Edge = johnSmith.addEdge(WorkEdgeLabel, acme)
    johnSmithAcme.setProperty("startDate", "2009-01-01")
```
In this case we're connecting the _johnSmith_ vertex to the _acme_ company directly using the _addEdge()_ method defined in the Vertex interface. 

## Querying the database
We can access our data using the _OrientGraph.command()_ method:
```
    val results: OrientDynaElementIterable = graph
          .command(new OCommandSQL(s"SELECT expand(in('Work')) FROM Company WHERE name='ACME'"))
          .execute()
```
that will return an _Iterable_ containing the results. In this case, the query finds out all the vertices of the _Person_ class that have a _Work_ relationship with the _acme_ company (or - in other words - all the vertices that have edges labeled _Work_ going out to vertices of class _Company_ that have the property _name_ set to _acme_); the _iterable_ contains as many elements as the vertices matching the query.
In this code sample, we can see how to access the edges of a vertex while iterating on the results:
```
    results.foreach(v => {

        // gets the person
        val person = v.asInstanceOf[OrientVertex]

        // checks if the out edge Work contains the "endDate" property
        val workEdgeIterator = person.getEdges(Direction.OUT, WorkEdgeLabel).iterator()
        val status = if (!workEdgeIterator.isEmpty && workEdgeIterator.next().getProperty("endDate") != null) "retired" else "active"

        println(s"Name: ${person.getProperty("lastName")}, ${person.getProperty("firstName")} [${status}]")
    })
```
since the GraphAPI is Tinkerpop compliant, we have to cast every element of the _Iterable_ to the implementation of Tinkerpop supplied by OrientDB (_OrientVertex_), and from this object access the edges. 

## Using SQL
Using SQL commands is straightforward:
```
    graph.command(new OCommandSQL("DELETE VERTEX V")).execute()
```
where graph is an instance of OrientGraph class.

          .command(new OCommandSQL(s"SELECT expand(in('${WorkEdgeLabel}')) FROM Company WHERE name='ACME'"))

        println("ACME people:")
        res.foreach(v => {

            // gets the person
            val person = v.asInstanceOf[OrientVertex]

            // checks if the out edge Work contains the "endDate" property
            val workEdgeIterator = person.getEdges(Direction.OUT, WorkEdgeLabel).iterator()

        })
