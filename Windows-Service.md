# Install as a Service on Windows

OrientDB is a Java server application. As most server applications, they have to perform several tasks, before being able to shut down the Virtual Machine process, hence they need a portable way to be notified of the imminent Virtual Machine shutdown.
At the moment, the only way to properly shut down an OrientDB server instance (not embedded) is to execute the *shutdown.bat* (or *shutdown.sh*) script shipped with the OrientDB distribution, but it's up to the user to take care of this. This implies that the server instance isn't  stopped correctly, when the computer on which it is deployed, is shut down without executing the above script.


## Apache Commons Daemon

[Apache Commons Daemon](http://commons.apache.org/daemon/) is a set of applications and API enabling Java server application to run as native non interactive server applications under Unix and Windows. In Unix, server applications running in the background are called *daemons* and are controlled by the operating system with a set of specified *signals*. Under Windows, such programs are called services and are controlled by appropriate calls to specific functions defined in the application binary. Although the ways of dealing with running daemons or services are different, in both cases the operating system can notify a server application of its imminent shutdown, and the underlying application has the ability to perform certain tasks, before its process of execution is destroyed. Wrapping OrientDB as a *Unix daemon* or as a *Windows service* enables the management of this server application lifecycle through the mechanisms provided natively by both Unix and Windows operating systems.


## Installation

This tutorial is focused on Windows, so you have to download *procrun*. [Procrun](http://commons.apache.org/daemon/procrun.html) is a set of applications, which allow Windows users to wrap (mostly) Java applications (e.g. Tomcat) as a Windows service. The service can be set to automatically start, when the machine boots and will continue to run with no user logged onto the machine.

1. Point you browser to the [Apache Commons Daemon download page](http://commons.apache.org/daemon/download_daemon.cgi).
1. Click on **browse download area**: you will see the index **commons/daemon/**.
1. Click on **binaries/**: you will see the index **commons/daemon/binaries/**.
1. Click on **windows**. Now you can see the index of **commons/daemon/binaries/windows**.
1. Click on **commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows.zip**. The download starts.
1. Unzip the file in a directory of your choice.
The content of the archive is depicted below:

```

|
\---NOTICE.txt

\---RELEASE-NOTES.txt
```
If version 1.0.15 is not listed, check [Apache Commons Daemon Windows download page](https://archive.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/windows/) directly.

**prunmgr** is a GUI application for monitoring and configuring Windows services wrapped with procrun. **prunsrv** is a service application for running applications as services. It can convert any application (not just Java applications) to run as a service. The directory **amd64** contains a version of **prunsrv** for x86-64 machines while the directory **ia64** contains a version of **prunsrv** for Itanium 64 machines.

Once you downloaded the applications, you have to put them in a folder under the OrientDB installation folder.

1. Go to the OrientDB folder, in the following referred as _%ORIENTDB_HOME%_
1. Create a new directory and name it **service**
1. Copy there the appropriate versions of **prunsrv** according to the architecture of your machine and **prunmgr**.


## Configuration

In this section, we will show how to wrap OrientDB as a Windows Service.
In order to wrap OrientDB as a service, you have to execute a short script that uses the prunsrv application to configure a Windows Service.

Before defining the Windows Service, you have to rename **prunsrv** and **prunmgr** according to the name of the service. Both applications require the name of the service to manage and monitor as parameter but you can avoid it by naming them with the name of the service. In this case, rename them respectively **OrientDBGraph** and **OrientDBGraphw** as *OrientDBGraph* is the name of the service that you are going to configure with the script below. If you want to use a difference service name, you have to rename both application respectively **myservicename** and **myservicenamew** (for example, if you are wrapping OrientDB and the name of the service is *OrientDB*, you could rename *prunsrv* as *OrientDB* and *prunmgr* as *OrientDBw*).
After that, create the file **%ORIENTDB_HOME%\service\installService.bat** with the content depicted below:

```
:: OrientDB Windows Service Installation
@echo off
rem Remove surrounding quotes from the first parameter
set str=%~1
rem Check JVM DLL location parameter
if "%str%" == "" goto missingJVM
set JVM_DLL=%str%
rem Remove surrounding quotes from the second parameter
set str=%~2
rem Check OrientDB Home location parameter
if "%str%" == "" goto missingOrientDBHome
set ORIENTDB_HOME=%str%
rem Remove surrounding quotes from the third parameter
set str=%~3
rem Check root password to stop server
if "%str%" == "" goto missingRootPassword
set ROOT_PASSWORD=%str%

EXIT /B

:missingJVM
echo Insert the JVM DLL location
goto printUsage

:missingOrientDBHome
echo Insert the OrientDB Home
goto printUsage

:missingRootPassword
echo Insert the root password
goto printUsage

:printUsage
echo usage:
echo     installService JVM_DLL_location OrientDB_Home root_password
EXIT /B
```

The script requires three input parameters:

1. The location of jvm.dll, for example _C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll_
1. The location of the OrientDB installation folder, for example *D:\orientdb-graphed-1.0rc5*
1. The password for root user (to stop server)

The service is actually installed when executing **OrientDBGraph.exe** (originally prunsrv) with the appropriate set of command line arguments and parameters.
The command line argument **//IS** states that the execution of that application will result in a service installation.
Below there is the table with the command line parameters used in the above script.

  <tr><td>--DisplayName</td><td>The name displayed in the Windows Services Management Console</td><td>Custom</td></tr>
  <tr><td>--Description</td><td>The description displayed in the Windows Services Management Console</td><td>Custom</td></tr>
  <tr><td>--StartClass</td><td>Class that contains the startup method (= the method to be called to start the application). The default method to be called is the <code>main</code> method</td><td>The class invoked in the */bin/server.bat* script</td></tr>

In order to install the service:

1. Open the Windows command shell
1. Go to _%ORIENTDB_HOME%\service_, for example typing in the shell <code>> cd D:\orientdb-graphed-1.0rc5\service</code>
1. Execute the *installService.bat* specifying the *jvm.dll* location and the OrientDB Home as full paths, for example typing in the shell <code>> installService.bat "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll" D:\orientdb-graphed-1.0rc5 ROOT_PASSWORD</code>
1. Open the Windows Services Management Console - from the taskbar, click on *Start*, *Control Panel*, *Administrative Tools* and then *Service* - and check the existance of a service with the same name specified as value of the <code>--DisplayName</code> parameter (in this case **OrientDB GraphEd X.X.X**). You can also use _%ORIENTDB_HOME%\service\OrientDBGraphw.exe_ to manage and monitor the *OrientDBGraph* service.

Example (in the `service` directroy) start and stop the service:

```
:start
OrientDBGraph.exe //ES

:stop
OrientDBGraph.exe //SS
```

Note that you need to start the OrientDB server once manually via `server.bat` in %ORIENTDB_HOME%\bin once, before starting the service.

## Uninstallation

Create the file **%ORIENTDB_HOME%\service\uninstallService.bat** with the content depicted below and run this file:

```
:: OrientDB Windows Service Uninstallation
@echo off
rem Uninstall service
OrientDBGraph.exe //DS
```
